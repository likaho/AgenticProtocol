# AgenticProtocol - Build LLM Apps Easily

  

### There are five main directories in your project:

  

1.  **chat-ui**: This folder is dedicated to the chat web client.

2.  **contracts**: Here, you'll find all the NFT (AGENTL) and ERC20 (AGEN) contracts.

3.  **core**: The core folder includes both client and server-side projects. It provides a no-code agent building tool and serves as the marketplace.

4.  **function_calling_llm**: In this folder, you'll find Python scripts responsible for function calling. They act as a proxy, deciding which tool or agent to call or redirecting calls to the Galadriel network.

5.  **galadriel**: This folder contains an Express web service that handles chat services. It forwards prompts to the Galadriel network.
